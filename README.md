## Project Summary

I deployed a threeâ€“microservice application (two backends + one frontend) that provides product details and dealer pricing and displays the information on a web UI. The services were built from the supplied repositories and deployed to IBM Cloud Code Engine. Everything is integrated and verified end-to-end.

## What I implemented â€” step by step 

### 1) Open Code Engine CLI & deploy Product Details microservice (done)

* Built and deployed the Product Details microservice from the `products_list` context of the backend repo.
* Service exposed on port **5000** and the final deployment URL was recorded.
* Screenshot of successful deployment:
  ![Product details deployment](images/product_details_deploy.png)

**Reference command (used):**

```bash
ibmcloud ce application create \
  --name prodlist \
  --image us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/prodlist \
  --registry-secret icr-secret \
  --port 5000 \
  --build-c ...
```

*(actual build options/flags used as required in the environment.)*

### 2) Deploy Dealer Pricing microservice 

* Built and deployed the Dealer Pricing microservice from the `dealer_details` context.
* Service exposed on port **8080** and the deployment URL was saved.
* Screenshot of successful deployment:
  ![Dealer details deployment](images/dealer_details_deploy.png)

**Reference command (used):**

```bash
ibmcloud ce application create \
  --name dealerdetails \
  --image us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/dealerdetails \
  --registry-secret icr-secret \
  --port 8080 \
  --build-c ...
```

---

### 3) Clone frontend repo and update endpoints 

* Cloned the frontend repository to the working directory and verified the clone.
* Screenshot of successful git clone:
  ![Git clone success](images/git_clone.png)

**Command used:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/dealer_evaluation_frontend.git
cd dealer_evaluation_frontend
```

* Updated `index.html` to include the two backend deployment URLs (ensured trailing `/`) â€” screenshot of the edits:
  ![Index URL changes](images/index_urlchanges.png)

---

### 4) Deploy frontend microservice 

* Built the frontend microservice and deployed it on Code Engine (port **5001** in this setup).
* Captured the deployment success screenshot:
  ![Frontend deployed](images/frontend_deploy.png)

**Reference command (used):**

```bash
ibmcloud ce application create \
  --name frontend \
  --image us.icr.io/${SN_ICR_NAMESPACE}/frontend \
  --registry-secret icr-secret \
  --port 5001 \
  --build-c ...
```

---

### 5) Verify UI: homepage & product list 

* Opened the frontend URL and verified the homepage loaded.
* Clicked the **Products** dropdown and confirmed products populated from the Product Details service.
* Screenshot of the homepage with the products list:
  ![Homepage showing product list](images/homepage.png)

---

### 6) Verify product â†’ dealer mapping 

* Selected a product, observed the dealers list populate (backend Dealer Pricing responded correctly).
* Screenshot showing product selected and list of dealers:

### 7) Verify specific dealer price 

* Selected a dealer for the product and verified the displayed price returned by
